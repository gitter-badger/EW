Announcement: Planned Integration with Edlightened
==================================================
It is official: the Quical, LDSM, and Study Mountain projects will be merging into a single platform which we call "Edlightened", a combined suite of all our educational software. Quical will be still supported, but we'll be shifting our focus away from our desktop build to planned integration with Edlightened. 

Study Mountain will become Edlightened Desktop, LDSM will become Edlightened mobile, and Quical will be merged into Edlightened desktop as a tool for students to check the accuracy of a student's answer.

Other details regarding the merge are yet to be determined: Keep tuned to this repository as well as others undergoing the merge, as well as the <a href= "http://emposoft.tk"<a>the Emposoft website</a> and the <a href= "http://qaro.tk"<a>Qaro bulletin board.</a>
